eQTL MPRA prediction challenge, task 1
Gifford lab, MIT CSAIL

Sequence-based features were generated for the candidate regulatory
regions given in the challenge.  First, probe sequences were obtained
for both studied alleles.  For the set of sequences, motif features
based on known transcription factor binding patterns from ChIP-seq and
PBM datasets were created.  Several approaches were used for this
task, including KSM, DeepSea, and DeepBind.  Chromatin state
annotations from the NIH Roadmap Epigenomics project were compiled for
all regions.  This compendium of features was used by an ensemble of
regularized regression and classification models to predict expression
values and regulatory hit status.  All learning algorithms were tuned
by cross-validation.  An ensemble of learning algorithms was combined
to produce the final predictions and confidence estimates.
