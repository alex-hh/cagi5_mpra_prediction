eQTL MPRA prediction challenge, task 2
Gifford lab, MIT CSAIL

Model predictions for log-fold change from task 1 were generated for
dataset2.  These predictions were used in models trained to predict
emVar status from log-fold change expression values in the sample
dataset.  An ensemble of binary classification models was considered,
with all regularization parameters tuned by cross-validation.  Models
used in the final ensemble included linear regularized logistic
regression, kernel regularized logistic regression, k-nearest
neighbors, and several SVM variants.  The predictions of all models
were combined to form the final probability estimate along with a
measure of confidence in the prediction.
